## ⚡ What is SPARK?
SPARK is a novel cognitive architecture designed to bypass the limitations of modern Transformers. Unlike passive LLMs that wait for prompts, SPARK is an **active agent** driven by an intrinsic curiosity loop.

It runs in **pure C** (no heavy Python dependencies), operates in **O(1)** memory complexity relative to sequence length, and learns continuously in real-time.

### Core Modules
* **Curiosity Engine:** A multi-scalar novelty detector that acts as the system's pacemaker.
* **Memory Bubbles:** A projective geometric memory system using randomized subspaces (Johnson-Lindenstrauss) for high-efficiency compression.
* **Affective Plasticity:** A biologically-inspired learning rule where emotion modulates synaptic updates.

## 🛠️ Development Methodology: The "Cyborg" Approach
This project is an experiment in **AI-Augmented Research**.
* **Concept & Architecture:** The theoretical framework and global logic were conceived by the human author over a 12-month research period.
* **Implementation:** The C kernels (`spark18.c`, `cg18.c`) and mathematical derivations were generated and refined by advanced LLM agents acting as "technical co-pilots".

This repository demonstrates that a single human architect, guiding synthetic intelligence, can build systems that rival traditional engineering teams.
